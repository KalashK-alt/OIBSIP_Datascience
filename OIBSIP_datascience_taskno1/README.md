Objective

The objective of this project is to classify iris flowers into their respective species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements. This is a beginner-friendly machine learning task often used as a foundation for understanding supervised classification.

#Steps Performed

>Data Collection

Used the standard Iris dataset (Iris.csv) which contains flower measurements.

>Data Preprocessing

Removed irrelevant columns (like Id).

Split data into training and testing sets.

Standardized feature values for better model performance.

>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized data using pairplots and correlation heatmaps to understand feature relationships.

>Model Training

Trained a Logistic Regression model on the iris measurements.

>Evaluation

Assessed performance using confusion matrix and classification report (precision, recall, f1-score).

>Model Saving

Saved trained model (iris_model.pkl) and scaler (scaler.pkl) for reuse.
